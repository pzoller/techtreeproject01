            <p>
                When I was a teenager my parent's bought me the Avalon Hill game <i> Panzer Leader</i>. That was my
                first exposure to wargames. I did buy a few Avalon Hill and SPI gmees as a teenager. Though I was not
                able to find many wargame players when I was young. I did run into a few D&D players, back when the
                white box version was available.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started player with other people when a local gamestore openned its backroom as an open playing area.
                From there I met a group of other young gentlemen that wound up being friends that I have known for
                decades. We had played lots of different tabletop and miniature war games.
            </p>

                I have tappered off playing table top role playing games due to having a busy schedule. Family and work
                allows me to do more things than play RPGs. I am still interested in gaming, and my current favorite
                game system is GURPS, published by Steve Jackson Gems.
